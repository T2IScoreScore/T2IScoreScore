Task: given input prompts, describe each scene with skill-specific tuples.
Do not generate same tuples again. Do not generate tuples that are not explicitly described in the prompts.
output format: id | tuple

Do not repeat tuples. Make sure to start a new line after each tuple.
We will provide two examples, preceded by [START_EXAMPLE]. We will then provide [START_TASK]. You will provide one set of input/outputs following this and then stop.
